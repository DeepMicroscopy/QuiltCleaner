![QuiltCleaner: Model-based Cleaning of the QUILT-1M Pathology Dataset â€¨for Text-conditional Image Synthesis](aux/quiltcleaner.jpg "QuiltCleaner")

Welcome to the QuiltCleaner repository. We labeled 1% of the QUILT_1M dataset for common image impurities that would be deteriorating image generation in a text-conditional image synthesis setting. We provide predictions for the remaining 99% of the QUILT_1M dataset. Additionally, we provide scores for text-image alignment as provided by the CONCH vision-language model.

## Base dataset

These annotations and predictions are complimenting the QUILT_1M dataset (Ikezogwo et al., NeurIPS 2023). Please look at [their repository](https://quilt1m.github.io) as to how to retrieve it.

## Categories

We annotated for the following categories:
- Narrator/person: Image with a visible person within the image
- Desktop/Window decorations/Slide viewer: Image where window decorators (e.g., close button, maximize button, title bar) or a complete slide viewer application, or even the windows task bar/desktop can be seen.
- Text/logo: Image contains visible text on top of the main pathology image, or one or multiple logos.
- Image of insufficient quality: Images in this category are mostly non-histology images (endoscopy, macro images, radiology images, only text images) but partially also just images with severe quality issues (blank image, severe blurryness).
- Additional slide overview: A slide overview (thumbnail) is shown on top of the actual slide image.
- Additional buttons/control elements: Additional control elements such as +/- buttons or rotation control are shown on top of the actual slide.
- Multi-panel image: Images consisting of multiple sub-images (panels). These are tricky for text-conditional image synthesis as the text might only describe a single (non-specified) panel.
